      body: "This Sunday I've been working consider around create-react-app version up strategy and wrote comment on the issue.  \nIf create-react-app support `esbuild-loader` officially, dev-server speed improve drastically.  \n\n- [Comment on We need regualr CRA maintainer #11180](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11180#issuecomment-890454128)\n\nAnd I had many activity really wide.  \nHowever, I don't have enough time to research and implement everything I'm interested in.  \nAnyway that's enough achievement I could make `sequelize-cli` based setup DB backend of [digital-strength](https://github.com/laststance/digital-strength/blob/afd5b17b66881e84aebc79014911cc086f6db265/package.json#L104-L111).\n\nI'd like to mounted DB organizer command kind of `db:migrate`, `db:seed:all` on create-react-app project.  \nIt's looks like Ruby on Rails! Sounds like a FullStack Framework totally!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n### Articles\n\n- [Keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts)\n- [visionmedia/debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#usage)\n- [Improved dark mode default styling with the color-scheme CSS property and the corresponding meta tag](https://web.dev/color-scheme/)\n- [prefers-color-scheme: Hello darkness, my old friend](https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme/)\n- [Analyze your Create React App bundle size - without ejecting](https://tjaddison.com/blog/2020/12/analyze-your-create-react-app-bundle-size-without-ejecting/)",
