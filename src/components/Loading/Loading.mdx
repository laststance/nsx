# Loading Component

The Loading component displays a full-screen loading indicator using a circular spinner animation. It's designed to provide visual feedback during data fetching or processing operations.

## Overview

This component creates a centered loading screen that occupies the full viewport. It uses the `CircleLoader` from react-spinners library to provide a smooth, consistent loading animation across the application.

## Features

- **Full-Screen Coverage**: Takes up the entire viewport
- **Centered Layout**: Uses CSS Grid for perfect centering
- **Consistent Styling**: Uses application color palette
- **Accessibility**: Includes proper test ID for testing
- **Performance Optimized**: Memoized with custom equality function
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## Usage

<Primary />

## Default Loading State

The component displays a large circular spinner in the center of the screen:

<Canvas of={LoadingStories.Default} />

## Implementation Details

The component is implemented as a memoized functional component with several key characteristics:

### Full-Screen Layout

```tsx
<div className="grid h-screen w-full place-content-center">
  <CircleLoader size={250} color="#9CA3AF" />
</div>
```

### Performance Optimization

The component uses `memo` with a custom equality function that always returns `true`, meaning it never re-renders once mounted:

```tsx
const Loading = memo(
  () => {
    /* ... */
  },
  () => true,
)
```

This optimization is appropriate because the Loading component has no props and its display should remain static.

## Props

The Loading component accepts no props. It's designed to be a simple, consistent loading indicator.

## Styling

| Property     | Value                       | Description                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `size`       | `250`                       | Large spinner size for visibility |
| `color`      | `#9CA3AF`                   | Gray-400 from Tailwind palette    |
| `layout`     | `grid place-content-center` | Perfect centering                 |
| `dimensions` | `h-screen w-full`           | Full viewport coverage            |

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import Loading from './Loading'

function App() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Loading />
  }

  return <div>App content...</div>
}
```

### Conditional Rendering

```tsx
function DataFetcher() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery('data', fetchData)

  if (isLoading) return <Loading />
  if (error) return <div>Error occurred</div>

  return <div>{data}</div>
}
```

### With React Router

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import Loading from './Loading'

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

## Accessibility

The component includes several accessibility considerations:

- **Test ID**: `data-testid="loading"` for automated testing
- **Screen Reader Friendly**: The animation provides visual feedback
- **No Interactive Elements**: Prevents user interaction during loading
- **High Contrast**: Gray color provides good visibility

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memoization**: Component never re-renders unnecessarily
2. **Simple DOM Structure**: Minimal markup for fast rendering
3. **CSS Grid**: Efficient layout solution
4. **Static Props**: CircleLoader props are constant

## Use Cases

- **Initial App Loading**: While the main application loads
- **Data Fetching**: During API calls and data processing
- **Route Transitions**: Between page navigations
- **Form Submissions**: While processing user input
- **File Uploads**: During upload operations

## Browser Support

The component uses:

- **CSS Grid**: Supported in all modern browsers
- **CircleLoader**: React Spinners library with broad support
- **Tailwind Classes**: Standard CSS properties

## Related Components

- **Spinner**: Smaller loading indicator for inline use
- **Button**: Uses Spinner component internally for loading states
- **Layout**: May contain Loading component during transitions

## Design System Integration

The Loading component follows the application's design system:

- **Color Palette**: Uses gray-400 (`#9CA3AF`) from Tailwind
- **Spacing**: Full viewport dimensions
- **Animation**: Consistent with other loading states
- **Typography**: No text content, purely visual

## Testing

The component includes a test ID for easy testing:

```tsx
// Test example
const loadingElement = screen.getByTestId('loading')
expect(loadingElement).toBeInTheDocument()
```

## Migration Notes

This component is stable and requires no migration. The react-spinners dependency should be maintained for consistent animation behavior.
