Project Overview:

NSX is a web application that automatically posts a list of web pages you read during the day.
It's used in combination with a browser extension called "nsx-browser-extension".
The project is still under development and is scheduled for release in 2028.
The ultimate goal is to release it as a personal blog starter kit for React developers, similar to a minimal WordPress.
Technology Stack:

Frontend: React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, TailwindCSS
Backend: Express.js, Prisma ORM, MySQL
Authentication: JWT
Testing: Vitest, Playwright for E2E testing
Build Tools: Vite, TypeScript
Deployment: PM2, Docker
Database Structure:

authors: Represents users with fields for id, name, password, and timestamps
posts: Represents blog posts with fields for id, title, body, and timestamps
stocks: Represents saved web pages with fields for id, pageTitle, url, and timestamps
Core Functionality:

Users can save web pages they read using the browser extension.
The application automatically creates a post of all the web pages read that day at midnight (via a cron job).
Users can manually create posts and include links to saved web pages.
Users can edit and delete posts.
The application has authentication for admin users.

NSX Project Overview
NSX is a web application that automatically creates blog posts containing lists of web pages you've read during the day. It's designed to work with a companion browser extension (nsx-browser-extension) that helps users save web pages they visit.

Project Status
The project is currently under development with a planned release in 2028. The ultimate goal is to release it as a personal blog starter kit for React developers, similar to a minimal WordPress. All core features are implemented, and the developer plans to distribute the repository source directly, similar to Beam.

Technology Stack
Frontend
React 19 with functional components and hooks
Redux Toolkit for state management with RTK Query for API calls
React Router for routing
TailwindCSS for styling
React Hook Form for form handling
React Markdown for rendering markdown content
Backend

Prisma ORM with MySQL for database access
JWT for authentication
bcrypt for password hashing
cron for scheduled tasks
Development & Testing
TypeScript for type safety
Vite as the build tool
Vitest for unit testing
Playwright for E2E testing
Storybook for component development
ESLint & Prettier for code quality
Docker for development environment

Database Structure
The application uses three main database models:

authors - Represents users with fields for id, name, password, and timestamps
posts - Represents blog posts with fields for id, title, body, and timestamps
stocks - Represents saved web pages with fields for id, pageTitle, url, and timestamps
Core Functionality
Web Page Saving & Automatic Posts
Users save web pages they read using the browser extension
A daily cron job runs at midnight (Asia/Tokyo timezone) that:
Fetches all saved web pages (stocks)
Creates a new post with links to all the saved pages
Clears the stocks table after creating the post
Manual Post Management
Users can manually create posts through the dashboard
When creating posts, users can include links to saved web pages
Users can edit and delete existing posts
Authentication
JWT-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies
Tokens expire after 15 minutes, but cookies last for 7 days
Protected routes for admin functionality
Frontend Features
Responsive design with TailwindCSS
Light/dark theme support
Pagination for post lists
Markdown rendering for post content
Form validation
